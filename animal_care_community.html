                <h3>Understand</h3>
                <p>
                  I started by understanding and defining the problems people
                  who work with animals face and what expert advice they look
                  for. I conducted competitive analyses into Fiverr and Rover to
                  gain insight into the market of expert apps and animal care
                  apps.

                <h4>Problem Statement</h4>
                <p>
                  Professional animal caretakers need a way to access expert
                  help that is timely, credible, specific, and cost-effective
                  because they want to continue to improve and enhance the lives
                  of the animals they are working with. We will know this to be
                  true when we see an increased number of professional animal
                  caretakers using this app to find the specific expert help
                  they seek.

                <h4>Hypotheses</h4>
                <p>
                  Hypothesis 1: We believe that by building an onboarding page
                  with a question(s) that reveals the user’s areas of interest
                  we will achieve tailored expert suggestions to increase user
                  satisfaction and positive feedback
                </p>
                <p>
                  Hypothesis 2: We believe that by creating a chat for users to
                  communicate with experts, we will achieve an increase in
                  users’ ability to get answers in a timely matter.

                <h3>Research</h3>
                <p>
                  I conducted interviews and surveys to gain an understanding of
                  users’ needs and goals when using an expert app to I could
                  focus my design on the real problems that potential users
                  face.

                      Getting information from credible sources is important to

                  Taking the ideas from the ideate phase, I developed wireframes

                <h3>User Testing</h3>
                <p>
                  Utilizing my previous research, I developed a test plan and
                  test script to use with real potential users as they tested my
                  prototype.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The goal of the testing was to study the learnability,
                  satisfaction, and identify any usability issues from first
                  time users. We observed and measured how successful users were
                  in navigating through the sign up/log in, messaging, and
                  appointment features of the animal care community app.

              <div>
                <p>
                  Before this project, I had no previous design experience. From
                  starting with sketches to submitting my last iteration of the
                  Animal Care Community Expert App, I am extremely proud of all
                  my work and all that I have learned. Through each iteration, I
                  got to try something new and learn how to use more tools in
                  Figma. As I worked on each new iteration, I always had the
                  feedback and needs of users on my mind.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When I got to perform user testing, I was able to make the
                  most adjustments to my design. This testing allowed me to
                  connect more with potential users and gain more insight into
                  the pain points that users experienced with earlier iterations
                  of the app. For example, in the first high-fidelity iteration,
                  I received feedback from users that they were unsettled by the
                  subscription plans wireframe. They believed that the app would
                  have free use, which it does, but it was confusing with how I
                  originally set it up. This helped me learn that I need to be
                  detailed, clear, and concise with each wireframe. Lastly,
                  gaining a better understanding of material design was a great
                  asset, I learned how to give a more seamless and transferable
                  experience for users when interacting with my app.
