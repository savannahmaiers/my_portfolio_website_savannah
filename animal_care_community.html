                                <p>I started by understanding and defining the problems people who work with animals face and what expert advice they look for. I conducted competitive analyses into Fiverr and Rover to gain insight into the market of expert apps and animal care apps.</p>

                                <p>Professional animal caretakers need a way to access expert help that is timely, credible, specific, and cost-effective because they want to continue to improve and enhance the lives of the animals they are working with. We will know this to be true when we see an increased number of professional animal caretakers using this app to find the specific expert help they seek.</p>

                                <p>Hypothesis 2: We believe that by creating a chat for users to communicate with experts, we will achieve an increase in users’ ability to get answers in a timely matter.</p>

                                <p>Utilizing my previous research, I developed a test plan and test script to use with real potential users as they tested my prototype.</p>

We observed and measured how successful users were in navigating through the sign up/log in, messaging, and appointment features of the animal care community app.</p>

                                <p>Before this project, I had no previous design experience. From starting with sketches to submitting my last iteration of the Animal Care Community Expert App, I am extremely proud of all my work and all that I have learned. Through each iteration, I got to try something new and learn how to use more tools in Figma. As I worked on each new iteration, I always had the feedback and needs of users on my mind.</p>
                                <p>When I got to perform user testing, I was able to make the most adjustments to my design. This testing allowed me to connect more with potential users and gain more insight into the pain points that users experienced with earlier iterations of the app. For example, in the first high-fidelity iteration, I received feedback from users that they were unsettled by the subscription plans wireframe. They believed that the app would have free use, which it does, but it was confusing with how I originally set it up. This helped me learn that I need to be detailed, clear, and concise with each wireframe. Lastly, gaining a better understanding of material design was a great asset, I learned how to give a more seamless and transferable experience for users when interacting with my app.</p>
